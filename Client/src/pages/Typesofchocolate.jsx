      <h1 className='text-center tracking-widest font-semibold text-[30px] translate-y-[170px]'>2 COMMON TYPES OF CHOCOLATES</h1>
      <h3 className='font-thin text-[15px] translate-y-[200px] pl-[480px]'>Dark Chocolate <br/>Milk Chocolate</h3>
      <h1 className='text-[30px] tracking-widest font-semibold translate-y-[220px] pl-[460px]'>DARK CHOCOLATE</h1>
      <h3 className='font-thin text-[15px] pl-[460px] translate-y-[230px]'>Needless to give an introduction to this exotic variety of chocolate. Dark chocolate is<br/> obviously one of the popular types of chocolate across the world. It is the closest form to<br/> pure cocoa. It is often termed plain or semisweet chocolate as no additives were included in<br/> its making. Nonetheless, it is evidently less sweet than milk chocolate.</h3>
      <h3 className='font-thin text-[15px] pl-[460px] translate-y-[260px]'>With typically three ingredients, the dark chocolate composition is relatively simple. It is<br/> purely made of chocolate liquor, cocoa butter and sugar. At times, small amounts of vanilla<br/> and soy lecithin, as an emulsifier will be added. As per FDA standards, dark chocolate must<br/> contain a minimum of 15% chocolate liquor and can go up to 50%. These are mostly vegan-<br/>friendly chocolates as it doesn't contain added dairy. At La Folie we make our chocolate with<br/> three ingredients in the most natural form using a plant based emulsifier sunflower lecithin<br/> and nothing else. Our cocoa beans are sourced using ethical transparent trade practices<br/> directly from farms and cooperatives, hence our cocoa beans, unrefined cane sugar and<br/> naturally processes cocoa butter are completely organic.</h3>
      <h1 className='text-[30px] tracking-widest font-semibold translate-y-[280px] pl-[460px]'>MILK CHOCOLATE</h1>
      <h3 className='font-thin text-[15px] pl-[460px] translate-y-[290px]'>Arguably, milk chocolate is the second most popular chocolate variety. With its creamy texture<br/> and sweet flavor, it is widely appreciated by people across boundaries. Irrespective of its<br/> name, this classic chocolate is light brown in color. It is peculiarly sweeter compared to dark<br/> chocolate, but not quite sweet as white chocolate.</h3>
      <h3 className='font-thin text-[15px] pl-[460px] translate-y-[310px]'>Typical milk chocolate is a perfect combination of chocolate liquor, sugar, and milk. To<br/> enhance its smoothness, soy lecithin will be added as an emulsifier at times. As per FDA<br/> standards, milk chocolate must contain a minimum of 10% chocolate liquor and 12% of milk.<br/> At La Folie we have 2 kinds of milk chocolate, one which is vegan made with organic coconut<br/> sugar and organic coconut milk powder and the other made with caramelised milk crumb,<br/> giving a smooth velvety caramel notes in our milk chocolate. We add in more than 35% of<br/> cocoa beans, which is more than the recommended  FDA, standard, hence making our milk<br/> chocolate more healthy with high % of cocoa beans and less % of cane sugars.</h3>
