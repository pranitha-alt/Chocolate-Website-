        <h3 className='font-thin text-[17px] pl-[400px] translate-y-16 tracking-widest'>The journey of a cacao bean is fascinating, from being encased in plump pods hanging from<br/> tall Theobroma cacao trees to packing their intense flavours in a luscious, silken smooth bar<br/> of chocolate. </h3>
        <h3 className='font-thin text-[17px] pl-[400px] translate-y-[80px] tracking-widest'>Here’s a handy guide that tells you all about how a cacao bean gets transformed into chocolate.</h3>
        <img src={image26} className='translate-y-[130px] translate-x-[500px]'/>
        <h3 className='tracking-widest font-thin text-[17px] translate-y-[170px] pl-[400px]'>Harvesting: It all begins with the cultivation of the cacao tree. Grown mainly in the tropics,<br/> the trees bear fruit in the form of pods, which contain cacao seeds or beans. Once ripe, the<br/> pods are harvested by hand, collected in baskets and sliced open, usually with a machete, to<br/> reveal the beans coated in a white pulp. Extremely bitter at this stage, the raw beans are<br/> carefully scooped from the pods.</h3>
        <img src={image30} className='translate-y-[180px] translate-x-[520px]'/>
        <h3 className='tracking-widest font-thin text-[17px] translate-y-[200px] pl-[400px]'>Fermenting: Once collected, the beans are heaped in wooden boxes, covered with banana<br/> leaves and placed under the sun. The heat, yeast, bacteria and the acids from the pulp – all<br/> help the beans turn brown in shade, lose some of its astringency and develop a natural,<br/> complex pre-cursor to the chocolate flavour. Depending on the temperatures and bean<br/> species, the fermentation process can last anywhere from four to seven days.</h3>
        <img src={image31} className='translate-y-[210px] translate-x-[520px]'/>
        <h3 className='tracking-widest font-thin text-[17px] translate-y-[230px] pl-[400px]'>Drying: Once fermented, the beans are laid out to dry in trays or mats to prevent mold<br/> growth. Smaller plantations usually follow the process of sun-drying while some also use wood<br/> fire. They are dried for days, until the moisture percentage<br/> reaches six to seven percent. They're then shipped to the chocolate makers.</h3>
        <img src={image32} className='translate-y-[240px] translate-x-[520px]'/>
        <h3 className='tracking-widest font-thin text-[17px] translate-y-[260px] pl-[400px]'>Roasting: Like with coffee, roasting is one of the most crucial steps in chocolate-making too.<br/> The beans are generally dry roasted, that is, without any addition of oil or fat. This helps<br/> develop their natural, classic cocoa flavour nuances and a robust aroma. To retain their<br/> inherent nutritional value and bring out their complex chocolatey flavours, the beans are slow<br/> roasted in small batches at precisely calculated low temperatures. </h3>
        <img src={image34} className='translate-y-[270px] translate-x-[520px]'/>
        <h3 className='tracking-widest font-thin text-[17px] translate-y-[290px] pl-[400px]'>Winnowing: Once roasted, the beans are cracked open by being passed through serrated<br/> cones. The thin, outer husks are separated to unveil pure cocoa pieces called cacao nibs. The<br/> shells are either used to brew tea or in compost.</h3>
        <img src={image33} className='translate-y-[300px] translate-x-[520px]'/>
        <h3 className='tracking-widest font-thin text-[17px] translate-y-[320px] pl-[400px]'>Grinding: The origin of the silken smooth texture of chocolate develops at this stage. The<br/> makers generally use stone or metal melangeurs to grind the nibs into a smooth cacao paste<br/> called chocolate liquor. In this process, the liquor is pressed to extract cocoa butter. Stone<br/> grinders are preferred since they don't add any additional flavour to the nibs, keeping their<br/> inherent taste intact. The butter, along with organic cane sugar, is then added to the<br/> melangeur to produce a smooth chocolate mass.</h3>
        <img src={image35} className='translate-y-[330px] translate-x-[520px]'/>
        <h3 className='tracking-widest font-thin text-[17px] translate-y-[350px] pl-[400px]'>Refining and conching: Heat, motion and time are essential to refining chocolate and that<br/> happens through conching. It's a process of agitating and aerating liquid chocolate using<br/> paddles and rollers for hours at a stretch. The intense process pulverises the mass to its finest<br/> quality, encasing every tiny particle with luscious cocoa butter and softening the cacao's<br/> flavour. The result: reduced acidity, a depth of flavour and a sensational mouthfeel.</h3>
        <img src={image36} className='translate-y-[360px] translate-x-[520px]'/>
        <h3 className='tracking-widest font-thin text-[17px] translate-y-[380px] pl-[400px]'>Tempering and moulding: Tempering involves heating, reheating and cooling chocolate so<br/> that it gets a uniform gleaming, glossy appearance and a crisp 'snap' that's music to the ears.<br/> When still warm, the liquid chocolate is poured into moulds and set. Each bar is replete with<br/> the flavour of cacao, each bar ready to be savoured.</h3>
